Oceanic coherent vortices are swirling bodies of water that play a crucial role in modulating the ocean material transport and circulation. This graduation thesis focuses on the characteristics of coherent vortices in the Argentine basin (AB), a key region for the Southern Ocean mode water formation. An objective Lagrangian method (LAVD) was adopted to extract the coherent vortices in the AB from 1993 to 2019 via satellite altimetry data. By comparing with results obtained by the Eulerian method, we verified the accuracy and robustness of the  LAVD method. A sum of 6212 coherent vortices were detected, with their geographical distribution, polarity, and migration patterns investigated. At last, we applied the same algorithm to SOSE dataset and extracted the three-dimensional structure of the eddies from 2013 to 2018.
